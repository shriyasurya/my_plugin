FUNCTIONALITY OF THE CODE-

-merge_subjects(dataframe, threshold=80) function:
   This function takes a DataFrame (dataframe) as input, along with an optional similarity threshold (threshold).
   It calculates the pairwise string similarity between subjects in the DataFrame using the Levenshtein distance (via fuzz.ratio()).
   It creates a graph (graph) using the networkx library and adds nodes corresponding to the subjects in the DataFrame.
   It iterates over the DataFrame and adds edges between subjects that have a similarity ratio greater than or equal to the threshold.
   It merges subjects based on connected components in the graph and selects the shortest subject as the merged subject.
   It updates the DataFrame with the merged subjects and returns the modified DataFrame.
-get_merged_subject(subject, merged_subjects) function:

   This function takes a subject and a list of merged subjects as input.
   It checks if any of the merged subjects are present in the given subject by splitting the merged subjects and searching for their presence.
   It returns the merged subject if found, or the original subject if no match is found.

The code calls the merge_subjects() function with a DataFrame df and a threshold of 80.
The merged DataFrame is stored in merged_df.
The merged DataFrame is printed using print(merged_df).
    The purpose of the code is to merge semantically similar subjects in a DataFrame, using a threshold-based method that measures string similarity.
